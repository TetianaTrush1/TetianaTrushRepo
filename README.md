# CPT_CREATION.ipynb :
file with calculations of Conditional Probability Table with such data input :
conditional probabilities of Risk Factors of Disease - Cervical Cancer.
P( Disease | Risk_Factor_state_n ). n -number of state (presnt/absent,etc,...)
The main non-triviality of this problem is that the probability of the disease is set in advance
The calculations use the rule of total probability as well as the Bayesian theorem (although in the calculations of input data)


# CPT_creation_3steps :
file with calculations of Conditional Probability Table for Disease Breast Cancer
using p0-value also known as Leak Probability
And also visualization of the problem - negative conditional probabilities and their periodicity

# Price_prediction.ipynb :
A file that links to a dataset that contains pricing information and other computer attributes.
My option is to predict the price using multiply linear regression algorithm
